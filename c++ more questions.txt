1)Write a C++ program to define a class named Circle.
private member: radius
public member functions:calculate_area(),calculate_circumference()


2)Write a C++ program to define a class named  Rectangle.
private member:length and width
public member functions:calculate_area(),calculate_perimeter()


3)Write a C++ program to define a class named  Person.
private member: name, age and country
constructor: initialized values (parameterized)
public member functions:getter()--->to get all values
                        change_age()--->to change the age of given objects.

4)Write a C++ program to define a class named  Person.
 same as above question ,but they have a extra constructor i,e a copy constructor
 create a object and copy all value of another object which get their value from constructor


5)Write a C++ program to define a class named Car.
protected member: company, model, and year
constructor: initialized values (parameterized)
public member functions:getter(),setter()

6)Write a C++ program to define a class named CarEngine 
which can inherit the above class Car and its visibility mode is public.
its own attribute are:
private member: engine_type,engine_no_of_cylinder
public member functions:getter() -->to get all values.(object of child class get all values including parent)

7)Write a C++ program to define a class named Triangle.
private member: lengths of its three sides
public member functions:calculate_area()-->using Heron's formula
determine_type()---->to determine if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.


8)Write a C++ program to define a class named Employee.
private member: name, employee ID, dep ,designation,performance(bad-0,avg-1,good-2,very-good-3,best-4 (use default constructor)
public member functions:setter(),getter()

9)Write a C++ program to define a class named EmpSalary which can inherit the above class Employee and its visibility mode is public.
its own attribute are:
private member: salary,basic,hra,da,pf (basic+hra+da-pf)
public member functions:salary(),bonus()--> if performance is equal to or above 2-->get bonus of 2000
create a object of child and display results.


9. Write a C++ program to implement a class called Student that has private member variables for name, class, roll number, and marks. 
member functions to calculate the grade based on the marks and display the student's information.


10. Write a C++ program to implement a class called Shape with virtual member functions for calculating area and perimeter.
Derive classes such as Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle from the Shape class and override virtual functions accordingly.

=======

Write a C++ program to define a class named Employee.
private member: name, employee ID, dep ,designation,performance(bad-0,avg-1,good-2,very-good-3,best-4)---> (use default constructor),salary.
public member functions:default constructor (taking input from user),getter()-->get all details
                        filter()-->in filter you have to pass a name of a employee as a argument, it can filter out the detail of all such employee.


#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

class Student{
  private:
    int employee_ID,performance,salary;
    string name,dep,designation;
  public:  
    Student(){
        cout<<"enter name of employee:";
        cin>>name;
        cout<<"enter Id:";
        cin>>employee_ID;
        cout<<"enter department :";
        cin>>dep;
        cout<<"enter designation:";
        cin>>designation;
        cout<<"enter salary:";
        cin>>salary;
        cout<<"enter Performance (bad-0,avg-1,good-2,very-good-3,best-4)";
        cin>>performance;
    }
    
   void filter(string s){
       if(name==s){
           cout<<"name:"<<name<<"salary:"<<salary<<endl;
       }
        
    }
    
};


int main(){
    
    Student s[3];
    string ename;
    cout<<"enter name do u want to search:";
    cin>>ename;
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
        s[i].filter(ename);
        cout<<"\n================================";
